### Flat Tube Scracth Defects Detection Algorithm

#### 1. Introduction
* This algorithm detects the scratches on the flat tubes by using Monte Carlo cubic Bezier curve fitting, and it is developped by C++;
* This project is using MFC of VisualStudio, and note that this code only including the key source codes in the MFC project, so if you want to use this code, please create a new MFC project and copy the core code to your project.
#### 2. Requirements
* VS2015 or higher
* OpenCV 2.4.13 or higher
#### 3. Datasets
The typical data used in this project can be downloaded from both Google drive or Baidu YunPan, which including 43 typical images captured by linear scan camera with the resolution of 600Ã—23000, all of the images are positive samples (having scratch defects):
